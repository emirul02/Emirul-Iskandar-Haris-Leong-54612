DevOps Internship Assessment

Thank you for the opportunity given. 

Although it did take some time for me to complete some of the task (as I am learning as well, it was my first time doing Ansible), I did enjoyed doing the task given.

For Disk Usage Alert task, I did not managed to configure the script to send an email using mail or sendmail. Only managed to print the Warning on the terminal (using echo command).
I couldn't figured out on how to set up SMTP server on the machine. Have tried to edit the /etc/mail.rc file.

Once again, Thank you.
