DevOps Internship Assessment

Thank you for the opportunity given. 

Although it did take some time for me to complete some of the task (as I am learning as well, it was my first time doing Ansible), I did enjoyed doing the task given.

For Disk Usage Alert task, I did not managed to configure the script to send an email using mail or sendmail. Only managed to print the Warning on the terminal (using echo command)

Once again, Thank you.
