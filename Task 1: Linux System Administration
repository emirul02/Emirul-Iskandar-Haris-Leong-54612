User and Group Management:
<---Create three users: devops_user1, devops_user2, and devops_user3--->
sudo useradd devops_user1
[sudo] password for root: ENTER ROOT's PASSWORD
sudo useradd devops_user2
sudo useradd devops_user3

<---Create a group called devops_group--->
sudo groupadd devops_group

<---Add devops_user1 and devops_user2 to devops_group--->
sudo usermod -a -G devops_group devops_user1
sudo usermod -a -G devops_group devops_user1

<---Ensure that devops_user1 has sudo privileges--->
sudo usermod -a -G sudo devops_user1
groups devops_user1
OUTPUT : devops_user1 : devops_user1 sudo devops_group

File Permissions:
<---Create a directory /opt/devops_data--->
sudo mkdir /opt/devops_data
[sudo] password for root: ENTER ROOT's PASSWORD

<----Create a file called project.txt inside /opt/devops_data and set the following
permissions:
• The owner should have read and write permissions.
• The group should have read permissions.
• Others should have no permissions--->

cd /opt/devops_data/
sudo touch project.txt
sudo chmod 540 project.txt 

<---Ensure that only devops_group members can read the project.txt file--->
sudo chgrp devops_group project.txt
ls -la
OUTPUT : -r-xr----- 1 root devops_group    0 Ogos 27 00:12 project.txt

Process Management:
<---Write a bash script process_monitor.sh that checks if a process (e.g., nginx) is running
If the process is not running, the script should start the process and log the event with
a timestamp to /var/log/process_monitor.log.--->
sudo nano process_monitor.sh
chmod +x process_monitor.sh
